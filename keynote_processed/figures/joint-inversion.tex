\caption{
    Joint inversion results of three different EM data sets:
    (1) Resolve (airborne FDEM), (2) Geotem (airborne TDEM), and (3) NanoTEM (ground TDEM).
    The panel on the left shows the true (black) and recovered 1D conductivity models the joint inversion (purple).
    On the right, we show the observed and predicted data for each of the three EM data sets.
