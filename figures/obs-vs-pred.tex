\caption{
    Comparison of observed and predicted data from each of the three inversions: (a) Resolve, (b) Geotem, and (c) NanoTEM. Joint inversion shows similar level of data fit as those shown here. The black and blue distinguish real and imaginary values for Resolve data. The solid line and cross marks indicate observed and predicted data, respectively.
