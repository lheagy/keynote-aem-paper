    The plight of a researcher in geoscience. The horizontal axis reflects time, and the vertical distance away from this axis reflects the effort that a researcher must invest in order to solve a problem. The lower curve represents the effort required to solve an algorithmic problem and the upper curve represents the effort required to solve an integrated multi-disciplinary geoscience problem using algorithms. The distance between these two curves represents the total effort required to solve a state-of-the-art applied geoscience problem.
